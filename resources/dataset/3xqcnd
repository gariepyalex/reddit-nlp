This means his red cells can be used by anyone who is A negative, A positive, AB negative, or AB positive. This covers almost 50% of the US demography. A positive alone represents just shy of 40% of the country. However, he can only receive red cells from A negative and O negative red cell donors, approximately 13% of the population. So for any given set of 20 people, he can help 8-9 of them but only 2-3 of them can help him.\n\nThis is seen most significantly in O negative red cells (approximately 6.6% of the US population), which can be used by any of the eight primary blood types. O negative recipients, however, can only receive from other O negatives. So while their blood can help 20 out of 20 recipients, they can only be helped by about 1 out of 20.\n\nFurther, the 97% of people you think are donating blood aren't.

The fact that there are 6% A- in the populations means that population will need 6% of the total blood the whole population needs by volume.  They contract diseases and get hurt at the exact same rates as everyone else.  Their demand is necessarily lower.\n\nWe don't need more total A- blood than 0- because A- is the rarer blood type.

In a perfect system, you would absolutely transfuse on a one-to-one match. A+ donors would get A+ red cells, O- donors would get O- red cells, etc.\n\nHowever, in emergency circumstances, you are going to transfuse O- red cells and AB plasma first because you don't have time to type on the side of the road when the helicopter lands. This means you need a disproportionate amount of O- and AB donors to meet those needs.\n\nThen, if O- is unavailable, you can in a pinch transfuse an O+ unit if someone has never been transfused before and hasn't built the antigen response. So now you need more O+ units than proportionate to the population.\n\nThen, your donor base doesn't give according to the demographic split. You can market to them in proportion to your needs (ask any O- donor and they'll tell you they get a LOT of phone calls, emails, texts, postcards, etc.) but particularly with first time donors, you don't know if that vein is going to give you the type you need or a type you're good on, and you won't know for a day or two after the donation so you're always marketing behind instead of ahead.\n\nThen, you can predict demand based on the general demographics but they don't play that way in reality. When a pregnant woman goes in for her delivery and starts hemorrhaging, the two units of A+ you set aside for her as a just-in-case becomes 20 units of O-, O+, A-, and A+ in whatever quantities you have plus whatever you stat order from the blood bank.\n\nSo hopefully with some context, you'll understand that your original assertion is still incorrect.

A Google search gave me a half-dozen news stories on the topic; [here's the first one](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117954), from September.\n\nWe don't actually know how many people in the US are LGBT because there is still a significant amount of bias in self-reporting (plenty of people will report as straight out of fear of retribution), but it is more than 3% and, I would expect, more than 5%. Certainly studies have shown that around 8% of US citizens have had a same-sex sexual encounter, and again, that's bound to be underreporting. You can find a summary of a lot of studies at the top of the [relevant Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States) ([mobile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States)).\n\nNow, this leads to two major complaints I have about this news. One is the focus on HIV. There are *plenty* of infectious diseases you can catch from a blood transfusion, but everyone is focusing on HIV. Instead of testing the donated blood, we're just saying \"you can't donate\" and hoping that's enough (this is a biased paraphrasing of what the receptionist and nurses told me the last time I donated). In high school, I saw plenty of girls that I knew got around a lot donating blood, while a gay couple I knew to be clean (neither of them had any other partners or and health problems) were banned from donating. The filter is flawed and never followed up with proper testing.\n\nThe other major problem is that a 12 month ban is essentially a lifelong ban. How long has it been since you last had sex? For most people, especially those healthy enough to donate blood, the answer is \"less than a year\", across all genders and sexualities. If the filter said \"straight men may not donate blood if they've had sex with a woman in the past 12 months\", the number of donors would drop *dramatically*, because that probably covers around 80% or more of male donors.\n\nThere's nothing scientific about saying \"because most people with HIV are gay men, gay men cannot donate blood\". That's just stereotyping. A scientific method would be to ask the important questions -- how many sexual partners have you had in the last year, what were their sexes, do you know if you have any STIs, when was the last time you were in a country at high risk of Malaria and for how long, etc -- and put those donations under additional screening and testing.\n\nAnd again, for emphasis, *we do have a blood shortage*. Cutting out even a small number of potential donors is a major problem, because it means we do not have enough blood to save lives. And we're cutting out more than just the obvious targets, because we're cutting out people like me who are terrified of needles and have started using politics as an excuse to not donate any more.\n\nTl;dr: there is a blood shortage, &gt;3% of the US is LGBT before accounting for people lying on surveys, blood donations are filtered instead of tested, those filters focus too much on HIV risk and not the hundreds of other lethal diseases that can be spread by blood donation, and this update to the filters doesn't allow most gay men to donate anyway.", :score 0, :replies [{:body "&gt;There's nothing scientific about saying \"because most people with HIV are gay men, gay men cannot donate blood\".

I am challenging the criteria they are asking for; For example: \"Have you had risky sexual behavior in the past 12 months: Including Anal sex, Unprotected sex, \"One Night stands\", or group sex\". This removes all Sexuality barriers and make it even MORE safe simply from Including all sexualities into this criteria instead of \"If you're a man have sex with another man, you cannot donate\". This is LOGICALLY more sound, it focuses on the cause of transmission, and it focuses on ALL sexualities.\n\nThere should be a criteria to not have Risky sex, not for Homosexual men to be Celibate for 12 months, because if we are going for statistics, most people age 20 - 24 shouldn't donate AT ALL because of the HPV chance.\n\nSource: http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/figures/48.htm", :score 1, :replies []}]}]} {:body "When politically correct gets in front of public health, you know we are doomed.", :score -8, :replies [{:body "&gt; \"These published studies document no change in risk to the blood supply with use of the 12-month deferral,\" the agency said. \n\nWhen pursuing your homophobic agenda gets in front of fucking reading, you know we are doomed.", :score 10, :replies [{:body "How can you verify that period of time was without intimate relations without direct observation?", :score 2, :replies [{:body "ANYONE can lie about what they say.
