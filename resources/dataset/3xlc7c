If you buy things on razor thin margins from a company that's *not making a profit*, sure. But when you buy from a company posting millions or billions in profit every year, you're not the one forcing this, it's entirely the company's choice.\n\nYou mention the iPhone, and it's a great example.

Workers are consumers are workers; low wages leads to low consumption which leads to companies cutting wages, and so on.  So it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to put the blame on people's consumption patterns, when most of the time they are doing what it takes to balance their own books and keep their finances afloat.  \n\nCapitalism creates systemic, downward pressure on wages and benefits; and its only been through militant labor organizing and mass movements that this pressure can be resisted and reversed (as opposed to individual consumers changing their buying habits).  \n\nHowever, you're right that its really, really difficult and possible counter-productive for workers in a single area to try to organize; the companies can easily shift production or fire everybody or some other thing to dodge and undermine militant workers.  This is why two more radical options need to be recognized and acted upon, by both would-be labor militants and their supporters: \n\n1) **Transnational organizing**: The more workers in different parts of the globe are linked up and coordinating, the less places capital has to \"run\" so to speak.  \n2) **Seizing the workplace**: Move beyond simple reformist demands and start seizing control of the means of production.  Companies can't shift production if workers and community supporters have taken over the factory and the farms and are working on their own terms.  \n\nThese aren't silver bullets or nothing, but thinking about these more radical strategies is an important step to be able to fight the labor battles of tomorrow.", :score 1, :replies [{:body "&gt; Capitalism creates systemic, downward pressure on wages and benefits; and its only been through militant labor organizing and mass movements that this pressure can be resisted and reversed (as opposed to individual consumers changing their buying habits)\n\nhistorically, but this is no longer the case. if you cannot lock a company in by controlling their production area - organizing doesn't work. today, with globalization, unions cannot do shit. you are seeing the most powerful ones created bleeding members in the US - no chance there is a worldwide union anytime soon.\n\nyou are correct about capitalism. it is the worst economic system ever devised, except for all others.
