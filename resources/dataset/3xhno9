", :score 6, :replies [{:body "Commenters keep saying that. But then why are we not seeing any major losses of area?", :score 10, :replies [{:body "What follows is largely conjecture. I certainly don't claim to be an expert but I am interested in the topic and have read many things from many sources, so here's my (perhaps baseless) answer to that question.\n\nI think that's because the situation is constantly in flux and there's probably no such thing as an accurate map reflecting the amount of land occupied at any one time by IS. Most of the maps that I've seen over the past year show Daesh holding huge chunks of land between Iraq and Syria. The reality is that they hold a number of population centers, most notably Raqqa and Mosul. In addition to those cities and their suburbs and satellite villages, Daesh also seized a number mid-sized Iraqi cities on the road to Baghdad back in October 2014 (Ramadi, Tikrit, Fallujah). As a result of their 2014 offensive, a lot of maps were produced in the media and online that depicted huge chunks of land under the control of the Islamic State. Now that I think about it, it is likely that on some level these maps helped legitimize the threat IS poses and their claims to statehood. \n\nHowever when it comes to territory that is actually occupied and administered full-time, it is very difficult to get a pulse on that. For instance we know that Raqqa, as the de facto capital, is garrisoned by militants and administered by what one might call \"civil authorities\" composed of members of the Islamic State. Then there are also the various (for lack of a better word) \"federal\" organs, also made up of IS personnel, that oversee intelligence, foreign recruitment, finance, propaganda, and I'm sure things like the oil trade, etc. However in Mosul, it's a different story. In this case it is fair to say that Daesh occupies the city. Their fighters keep order (using terror and violence) and tax the local economy (\"we've got the monopoly of force so give us a cut or else\"). I find it difficult to believe that Mosul is administered in the same way as Raqqa. I think it's more likely that IS has made a deal with local leaders on the ground to avoid more widespread violence and to keep order. The Iraqi army and police melted away, but that doesn't mean that all of the traditional bases of power (local notables, i.e. wealthy families, necessary bureaucrats/technical professionals, religious leaders, neighborhood and ethnic leaders) did as well. \n\nThen we come to the mid-sized cities I mentioned. The Iraqis, although they have taken their sweet time, have had some success pushing IS out of these places. Due to the fact that these towns have been more or less on the front lines since last October, I see it highly unlikely that there was any IS presence in those places beyond their militant presence, the vanguard that advanced in the first place. And due to the utter disorganization of the Iraqi forces until relatively recently, these towns and cities could have been held by a fraction of the amount of men that opposed them on the Iraqi side. Keep in mind too that when it came to retaking Baiji, Ramadi, Tikrit, and the like, the Iraqi military had almost total freedom of maneuver beyond being harassed by IEDs and the like. This indicates that the Islamic State simply did not exist outside of population centers but for a number of checkpoints manned by armed men.\n\nSo I guess what I'm getting at is that the actual amount of land that IS sits on was greatly exaggerated from the beginning of their invasion of Iraq. The same could be said for Syria, where up the river from Raqqa the Syrian government maintains a presence in Deir ez-Zor in addition to a number of army and air force facilities in the region. So again, if you factored in only the territory that IS actually has a physical presence in, you end up with a bubble around Raqqa (probably the only place that IS rules completely on its own with an iron fist), a bubble around Mosul, and perhaps the roads between them. But with coalition airstrikes severely hampering movement, it's likely that there is no longer much of a connection even between those places. \n\nAnd lastly, there was an article posted on here recently that claimed that IS had lost 40% of its populated territory in Iraq. I can't vouch for the veracity of that number, but I do believe that the evidence points toward that conclusion. For some in Daesh, I imagine this war is starting to feel like Götterdämmerung.

That is basically a battalion-sized skirmish that has gone on for months and months and months. And to really occupy territory the size of what IS claims to have, you would need hundreds of thousands if not a million troops (the US for example deployed about 150,000 troops at the height of the surge to Iraq, and we got only so-so results.
