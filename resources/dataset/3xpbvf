It’s very serious. But it wasn’t violent or intentional, and the preference of the state is to not send juveniles to jail.” He adds: “Studies show that once you send somebody to jail, particularly as a juvenile, they tend to stay a criminal.”\n\nEdit: I have a feeling where the replies to my comment are headed.  Rather than try to debate with people, I'll just note that empathy is a pretty cool thing to have.  It doesn't mean you condone the bad things that people do, but that you try to understand why they do them.  Saying \"they were bad and must be punished\" might make you feel good (e.g. safe) but it doesn't help anything in the long run.  Asking \"why did they do this and how can we prevent it from happening again?\" is a lot more likely to improve the present and future lives of all humans.  \n\nEdit2: A lot of people are getting hung up on Ethan's lawyer saying the crime wasn't violent.  The legal definition my brief googling came up with for a \"violent crime\" is as below.  An unintentional car accident would not, in my opinion, meet either of these criteria.  Though I imagine many of you will disagree.  \n\n&gt;The term “crime of violence” means—\n\n&gt;&gt;(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or prop­erty of another, or\n\n&gt;&gt;(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\n\n", :score 393, :replies [{:body "It's important to note the only reason this case caught notoriety, is because they presented \"affluenza\" as a defense.
