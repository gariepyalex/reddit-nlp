I understand that risk of injury and diseases goes up with age, and flexibility/dexterity seems to decrease with age, but I've read numerous reports that males actually tend to reach peak physical strength and muscle mass at 30.\n\nBack on topic:\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17186303\n\nA small study on hand strength (which is shown to have a high correlation to the ability to carry heavy loads) compared 1500+ men and 500+ women between the ages of 20-25. They then included as a separate group 60 national level female athletes from sports correlating with a need for hand strength.\n\nPredictably, the males outperformed the females by a significant margin (double), where 90% of females performed worse than 95% of males in the same randomly selected category.\n\nWhat's interesting about this study, though, is that it shows (acknowledging small sample, of course) that even professionally trained female athletes are unlikely to compete with men on the subject of hand strength. The professionally trained athletes outperformed only the bottom 25th percentile of the untrained males.\n\nThis is only a single metric, though. I've heard that men's upper body skeletal mass is 40% more than that of females, and muscle mass is significantly less in females and continues to diverge further through the early twenties until reaching peak disparity in the 30s. I've seen, however, that males and females reach peak endurance at the same age, with males having the edge throughout life, but in terms of lower body and core strength, men and women are somewhat comparable at most ages if you adjust for child-birth complications with core strength.\n\n*****\n\nWhat I'm curious about would be how far the male/female ratio would fall were the global PFT standards to be raised to the male level.

So the Navy can have women meet the gender-neutral standards for SEAL training, even if those women would never meet the actual unwritten standards required to pass BUD/S.\n\nAnd that's because those unwritten standards are qualitative in nature. Training is more than just being able to run X miles in Y minutes, or do 100 pushups. It's about being mentally strong enough to fit the team, be of the right makeup to succeed, etc. Those aspects can't be written into regulations since they're *very* qualitative in nature - but that also means that higher ups can push candidates through.\n\nDon't believe higher ups will listen to the politicians to push these things through?\n\nThe Navy went through the SAME scenario in the early 90s when fighter pilot jobs were opened to women in the military. The Navy raced to beat the Air Force to get the [first American female fighter pilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Hultgreen). End result? She stalled her F-14 while trying to land on an aircraft carrier. \n\nHer back seater (think Goose, from Top Gun) - who ejected 0.4 seconds earlier than her, the front pilot - survived. She didn't, because in those 0.4 seconds, the plane had rolled enough inverted that she was ejected into the water at 60 feet up and killed.\n\nThe Navy publicly said it was a mechanical issue - until someone in aviation leaked the internal mishap investigation. The findings were that it wasn't mechanical at all but due to pilot error. They also found deficiencies in her training including times where she was passed by superiors over the complaints of her instructor pilots for things where other male students were failed. \n\nSo in the race to get this done, the Navy ended up getting a young woman killed and nearly got another person killed as well - all to please politicians and keep up appearances.\n\nedit: typo\n\nAlso, since people were wondering, what happened to the other female fighter pilots?\n\nThe [second one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carey_Lohrenz) was actually removed from the F-14 Tomcat as well when it was found she had multiple failures in training as well:\n\n&gt;She was one of the two first candidates in the US Navy to become a female fighter pilot in the F-14 Tomcat, but was taken out of the F-14 airframe eventually due to multiple failures as a trainee pilot, despite several extra opportunities given due to her being one of the first females in the male-dominated arena of fighter pilots. \n\nThe full report on this pilot actually shows that she had broken many rules in training including releasing bombs too low (which would frag your own plane), not ejecting in a simulator when your airplane runs off the runway at high speeds on an emerhence landing, and failing her field carrier landing practices and getting second chances when her male companions were not.\n\n", :score 340, :replies [{:body "That is horrendous.", :score 66, :replies [{:body "That is affirmative action.", :score 22, :replies [{:replies []}]}]} {:body "&gt; and failing her field carrier landing practices\n\nSee, this is where you lost me.
