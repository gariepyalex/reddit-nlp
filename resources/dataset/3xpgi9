It isn't the GMO itself that is necessarily the problem. It's the system of production and the unintended effects that such a system creates.\n\nExamples.  Pesticide (glyphosphate) resistant GMOs result in more intensive use of pesticide which then results in collateral environmental damage and possible human gut microflora alterations.
