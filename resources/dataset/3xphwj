If you want no government regulations on what your corporation does, then be prepared to except total liability for what that corporation does.\n\nCurrently, a business owner is allowed to create a legal fiction.

Even in the case where a single owner provides the starting money for the business, retains 100% ownership, and exerts complete control, we let them create a corporation. If the \"corporation\" harms someone, then that harmed party can only sue for assets stored under the corporate name, rather than the other assets of the business owner. \n\nLandlords often do this. Even a small-time landlord who owns several rental properties might place each property in a different LLC. Thus, if a tenant is severely injured due to shoddy maintenance, the tenant will only ever be able to sue up to the value of the property.
