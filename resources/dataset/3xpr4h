So is the next DA going to make the same mistake? It is the same thing with cops. We jump on cops for wrong doing but when a cop does the right thing, we do not have protests and movement for the injustice. Why? I am guessing, it is because we have an illusion of how things should be and not how they are. We have movies and culture of cops as being the good guy or the hero. Well they are people in a system that is rigged.            \n              \nRigged system needs to be fixed and it will not be fixed by targeting individual cops or DAs. The is one simple solution. The crime investigation should be conducted by an independent agency, not the police. By having 3 agencies, they will work like checks and balances in the government.
