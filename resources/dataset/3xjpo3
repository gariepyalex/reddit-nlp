In practice, as the original uploader, you'll probably be seeding a lot more copies, for a longer duration. While there is some risk in doing this, with a little bit of work you can mitigate it. I won't claim it is entirely without risk, but it is for a petty good cause. \n\nThe main way people are caught torrenting is by recording the IP address which is either receiving, or sending the file.

Not saying that it makes you entirely invisible against the NSA, but it does a pretty damn good job against DMCA threats. Since most VPNs don't keep logs, by the time they are notified that their IP was infringing, they can simply throw their hands up and say \"Ah, sorry, but I have NO CLUE who that was!\"\n\nAnother way is a torrent box, which is something you have to pay a subscription to, but you don't really have to deal with the hassle of your computer running a VPN, or configuring it. You simply set it up, provide the files you want to torrent, and also the files you want to download, and leave it alone.

I am a professional who works as an accountant. I have done an extensive amount of research into the problem of higher education in the United States and the world. \n\nThe first step is free open source textbooks that are created by the community of academics, professionals and students. People talk about how great all this technology is for education (AI, machine learning etc.) but most of it is worthless if you don't have some sort of high quality knowledge base to use. The big textbook publishers have absolutely no intention of releasing their copyrighted materials for low-cost. Been there done that.\n\nSo what is my theory for developing the next generation of open source, high quality and free textbooks? My hope is that I'll write the rough draft for the book and then have it peer reviewed by other students, professionals and academics. It will then be released as a public domain book. The fundamental theories behind financial accounting rarely change (most of the changes occur for intermediate accounting and beyond) so once the book is written then revising it will be a piece of cake. I also plan on writing many other textbooks but I'll only be able to do that with some sort of monetary assistance. What I have noticed is that most people don't like to be the first to start the project. The average person just likes to edit, revise and add to sections here and there. To solve this problem I plan on having non-intrusive advertising (ie. google adsense or 30 second video ads etc.) which will help finance future books or educational resources. The ad dollars generated will help jump start the rough draft for future books or to pay for services that cannot be sourced from volunteers (professional looking graphics, covers, interactive resources etc.). \n\nWith the advertising, it is important to note that this advertising has zero impact on the subject matter. I will be using video ads and pay-per click ad networks. I've also considered crowd funding the development of the books as well. That might be another option in-lieu of the advertising idea. Right now, it seems the advertising idea is the most realistic way to get funds to finance the development of future books. Overall, it is a win-win.

You can either view it as altruism for the sake of educating others, or you can view it as done out of self-interest, because writing a popular textbook does bring name recognition.\n\n2. India has an agency called NCERT (National Council of Research and Training) which I wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3xjpo3/india_to_make_available_all_textbooks_online_for/cy5ajbn).
