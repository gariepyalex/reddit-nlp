However racism that occurred 60 years ago it is not the racism of today.  \n\nBut the fact of the matter is, regardless of how we want to define or frame it, the modern issues don't come down to what I would call racism.  Modern issues may have racist edges, but largely these are problems which are seen due to the fact that being poor in the United States is a sinkhole.\n\nI am personally of the opinion that one of the largest issues that anyone fighting for racial equality should be focusing on in the United States is income equality.

And it would make our country a better place to live for everyone.\n\nIn my option, even if every person who was racist in the United States suddenly became totally colour-blind to other people, and racism was magically wiped away, it would absolutely not fix the problems that are causing the majority of issues in black neighborhoods.  People are not criminals because they are black, and that is an absurd thing to need to say.
