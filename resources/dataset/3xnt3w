And if you don't watch the news, it doesn't affect you.\n\nI don't get what people are up in arms about with regards to the news. It's all trash anyway, has been for decades. Before Nightcrawler the film to point to was \"Network\" in the 70s. Hell, before TV, Mark Twain was railing against the newspapers and 'news' back in the late 1800s. \n\nNightcrawler is no more 'true' than Network or the news itself. All these things exist to do one thing: Motivate people into actions. That's what the news is for. That's what that movie was for. That's why Mark Twain wrote, \"A newspaper is not just for reporting the news as it is, but to make people mad enough to do something about it.\"\n\nTwain wrote a lot about newspapers, actually:\n\n&gt; It has become a sarcastic proverb that a thing must be true if you saw it in a newspaper. That is the opinion intelligent people have of that lying vehicle in a nutshell. But the trouble is that the stupid people -- who constitute the grand overwhelming majority of this and all other nations -- do believe and are moulded and convinced by what they get out of a newspaper, and there is where the harm lies.\n\nBottom line? You've put *far too much* faith in the news already. Nightcrawler shouldn't have been necessary to convince you that it's unfounded faith, the *very existence of 'the 24-hour news cycle'* should've done that. I find it kinda sad that some need something as hamfisted as Jake Gyllenhall's crazy-face act to realize this. I only single it out because it's like once a day on reddit that I see some story about terrible journalists and a comparison to this film. \n\nI grew up with Dateline and 20/20 being the 'in' shows on the news, and what were those always about? \"**Why you should live in fear this week, story at 11!**\". Every. Single. Day. Without fail. \n\nThe news isn't broken, the media isn't broken. Journalists aren't 'worse' today than they were a century ago. They're not 'broken' or 'worse' because *this is what they're intended to do*. Nightcrawler isn't a depiction of a terrible, unethical and bloodthirsty journalist, it's a depiction of *journalism at large*, full stop. Journalism *is* bloodthirsty. Being unethical is built right into the system: It's a *constant* balancing act between 'getting the scoop' vs 'staying within ethical boundaries'. And what brings ratings?
